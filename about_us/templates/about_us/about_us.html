                    Longdogs was created in 2015 to fulfill a need from Sighthound owners for quality, good value products. As an owner of Greyhounds and Whippets all my life I am ideally placed to source items that I know you and your dogs will love. 
                    The specific requirements of 'Longdogs' mean they don't often fit into regular dog clothing and also have particular requirements when it comes to bedding and feeding. 
                    I research and build relationships with suppliers to ensure that you the customer is offered high quality at a reasonable price.
                    Please feel free to browse the <a href="{% url 'products' %}"> store </a> and also check out the <a href=""> articles </a> page for all things 'Longdog'
