# Longdog
Longdog is my submission for Milestone Project 4.Longdog is an e-commerce site dedicated to the needs of Sighthound owners and their dogs. The site will sell clothing, toys and accessories, in fact anything a Longdog might require!
The basic features of browsing the content and making a purchase can be carried out without registering, however the user is encouraged to register in order to make future ordering simpler and they will also be able to contribute to the site by leaving feedback in the form of product reviews.

### Typography
The font I have used for the majority of my site is Patrick Hand SC from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Patrick+Hand+SC). I choose this font because it has an informal, handwritten style whilst still being easy to read.
### Colour Scheme
I have stuck to a very simplistic black and white colour scheme. The pops of colour come from the products and the hero images on the Home, About Us and FAQs pages. The site could easily be adapted in the future to reflect a specific branding but I like the elegant, uncluttered feel it has currently.
### DataBase Diagram

## Features:
- ### Top Header
  The top of my site has the Longdog brand name top left. The search bar is situated in the middle of the screen in a prominent position. The 'My Account' and 'Shopping bag' icons are in the top right corner. This layout will be familiar to most users of e-commerce sites and will allow them to navigate the site intuitively.

  ![Nav bar mobile](media/screengrabs/top_header.jpg)
- ### Navigation Bar    
  I used Bootstrap to build my navigation bar, it collapses down on mobile screens and becomes a burger menu. The options available are HOME/ABOUT US/CLOTHING/HOMEWARE/FAQS. The navbar is fixed so it can be accessed easily from wherever the user is in the site.

  ![Nav bar mobile](media/screengrabs/navbar_mobile.jpg)    
  On desktop the user has the same options apart from Home as the Longdog logo at top left will return users to the home page

  ![Nav bar desktop](media/screengrabs/navbar_desktop.jpg)    

  I chose to keep the search option available to non-registered users as I wanted first-time visitors to be able to explore the site and its products before committing to registering.
  Underneath the navbar is a banner advertising the free delivery threshold of Â£50. This banner could be easily changed by the site administrator to display special offers or any other information they wanted to convey.    


  - ### Home Page    
  ![Home page](media/screengrabs/home.jpg)    
  The home page is simple with just the hero image, a short introductory text panel and a call to action button. The home page is really just a taster and a means to direct the user to the areas of the site they are interested in. The hero image by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@sapegin?utm_content=creditCopyText&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=unsplash">Artem Sapegin</a> on <a href="https://unsplash.com/photos/short-coated-brown-dog-Ugg-EIfzy0c?utm_content=creditCopyText&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=unsplash">Unsplash</a> really grabs the users attention but also conveys the type of products that the site will be selling - elegant and stylish.
  The short text panel welcomes the user to Longdog but it is expected that as it is a sighthound specific site that the user will probably have been directed there by user recommendation or a site engine search so does not go into detail about the site.
  The prominent 'Shop Now' button is a call to action directing users to the Products page.


  - ### About Us Page    
  ![About Us page](media/screengrabs/about_us.jpg)  
  The About Us page is probably the first place that new visitors will navigate to. The page is split into two sections, on desktop the first section 'About Us' has an image and text box displayed side-by-side whereas on mobile these are stacked.

  ![Contact Us page](media/screengrabs/contact_us.jpg)      
  The second section 'Contact Us' contains a message form. There are input fields for Subject, message and email address which are all required fields. A non-registered user can send a message which I saw as a way to encourage new visitors to engage with the site owners and obtain information without commitment.
  The Contact Us form is also linked to from the FAQs page under the 'Contact Us' subject header.
  Once the user has submitted their message they will receive a confirmation pop-up message in the top right of the screen, this message can be dismissed by clicking the close icon. 

  - ### Products Page  
  ![Products Page](media/screengrabs/products.jpg)    
  The user navigates to the products pages by selecting one of two categories CLOTHING or HOMEWARE. I chose these two as they encompass the range of products that I wanted to sell. Clothing is further broken down into Pyjamas & Housecoats, Outdoor Coats and Accessories. Homeware is further broken down into Beds, Feeding and Toys. It would be very easy to expand these categories in the future as the website grows.
  Once on the Products page you are presented with a 'sort box' dropdown which allows you to sort by Price or Name (ascending & descending). There is a counter that informs the user how many products are in the category selected.
  Each product has an image, name and price. I could have added more information but in order to keep the view manageable on mobiles I chose these three features. There is a 'back to top' arrow in the bottom right corner to enable the user to return quickly to the top without having to scroll.
  Once the user finds a product they are interested in they can click on the image and this will take them to the Product Detail page.

  - ### Product Detail Page  
  ![Product Detail](media/screengrabs/product_detail.jpg)      
  The product detail page provides more detail about the selected product. At present there is only one image per product but I would like to develop this in the future to display a carousel of images and the ability to zoom in on an image as I think this is expected from most users.
  Under the image there is the Product Name, Price and a Description. This description provides more information and in the case of products with sizes it directs users towards the measuring guide within the FAQs section. It would have been nice to make the measuring chart a modal that pops up when clicked but unfortunately I ran out of time.
  Next there is a Size dropdown box with the options S, M or L, again this could obviously be developed further to include a wider range if required.
  There is also a Quantity dropdown box for the user to select how many they would like to purchase. The range has been set from 1-99 as default.
  Underneath there are two button options 'Keep Shopping' which returns the user to the Products page so they can continue browsing or 'Add to Bag' which will display a pop-up success message confirming that the product has been added to the bag with a summary of the contents.
  Finally at the bottom of the page there is a Reviews section. This section allows all users to read posted reviews but also gives registered users the option to write a review.    
  ![Add review](media/screengrabs/add_review.jpg)     
  The form has input fields for User, Title and Review. There is also a dropdown from which the user can select the product they are reviewing. In the future I would like to pre-populate this with the product details as a dropdown would become very unwieldly. At the bottom of the form the user has the option to 'Cancel' or 'Submit' their review. The user can only edit/delete their own reviews not other users. At the moment the reviews are posted without being checked by the admin but this would obviously be a useful feature to implement. 

  - ### Shopping Bag Page    
  ![Shopping Bag page](media/screengrabs/bag.jpg)  
  The Shopping Bag view details the contents of your bag before checking out. It displays the product image, name, size (if applicable) and price. Beneath each item there is the option to increase or decrease the quantities or remove the item completely. If any of these options are taken the bags grand total adjusts accordingly. There is also a really handy message displaying how much more you need to spend to obtain Free Delivery. This will obviously be an incentive to make an extra purchase to save on the delivery costs.
  Once the user is happy they can either 'Keep Shopping' or proceed to the 'Secure Checkout' via the buttons on screen.

  - ### Checkout Page    
  ![Checkout page](media/screengrabs/checkout.jpg)  
  The Checkout page is split into four sections. The first details the order listing the individual items and giving a grand total. The next section is 'Details' containing a form field asking for Full Name and Email Address (both required fields). Following that there is a 'Delivery' section requiring the user to input Phone No., Address, Poscode and Country. There is then a prompt to encourage non-registered users to create an account or for registered users to login. The advantage of registering being you can keep track of past orders in the 'My Profile' section and also the delivery details will be saved for future purchases. Finally there is the 'Payment' section which asks for a 'Card number' and 'Expiry Date'. Once happy the user can 'Complete Order' or return and 'Adjust Bag'.
  On completion of checkout a confirmation pop-up will appear in the top right-hand corner to provide reassurance that the purchase was successful. The user will also receive an email confirmation of their order.    
  ![Checkout page](media/screengrabs/order_success.jpg)

  - ### Profile Page    
  ![Profile page](media/screengrabs/profile.jpg)  
  The registered user has the advantage of the Profile page where their past orders can be viewed. The Default Delivery Information is also stored here making subsequent checkouts quicker. The registered user has the option of updating their information here as well.
  There is a really nice amount of detail given on past orders with the order no., date, items and order total. You can also click on the order no. to access more detail such as delivery address and contact details. From the Profile page the user can access the dropdown menu under 'My Account' to Logout. the site admin will also see the added option of 'Site Management' from where products can be added or edited. 

  - ### FAQs Page    
  ![FAQs Page](media/screengrabs/faqs.jpg)    
  The FAQs page is where the user can visit to find out the most commonly asked questions. Currently I have questions on measuring your dog, delivery, returns and contact info. I would anticipate this page to be added to as the business develops.
  The top of the page contains a lovely image of two sighthounds by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@pupscruffs?utm_content=creditCopyText&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=unsplash">Katie Bernotsky</a> on <a href="https://unsplash.com/photos/white-and-black-short-coated-dog-YA2jb4V0JAU?utm_content=creditCopyText&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=unsplash">Unsplash</a>.
  I have used a Bootstrap component called Accordion to create the FAQs. This is a really nice feature that displays the header (the question) and once clicked drops down to reveal the content (the answer). This works particularly well on mobiles and fits with my mobile first design.

  - ### Sign Up Page    
  ![Sign Up Page](media/screengrabs/signup.jpg)    
  The sign up page is presented to users if they choose to register either by selecting 'Register' from the My Account dropdown or as part of the checkout process. They are reminded that if they already have an account they can simply 'Sign In' instead. The required fields are email, username and password. Notifications are set up to alert users they are already registered or the password they have selected is too short, too easy etc..
  I feel I have the right balance between features non-registered and registered users have access to. Guests can still make purchases which is the purpose of the site and message the site owner but registered users have the added features of being able to leave reviews and checkout quicker. This could be changed in the future if the site owner wanted new features to be restricted to registered users only.

  - ### CRUD    
  Within my site users have the ability to:
  * CREATE by adding reviews and sending messages 
  * READ by searching for products within the database
  * UPDATE by editing their orders and reviews
  * DELETE their orders and reviews
