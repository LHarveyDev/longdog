# Longdog
Longdog is my submission for Milestone Project 4. Longdog is a Full-Stack e-commerce site dedicated to the needs of Sighthound owners and their dogs. The site will sell clothing, toys and accessories, in fact anything a Longdog might require!
The basic features of browsing the content and making a purchase can be carried out without registering, however the user is encouraged to register in order to make future ordering simpler and they will also be able to contribute to the site by leaving feedback in the form of product reviews.
This project has been created using HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Django. Stripe was utilised to facilitate payments and Bootstrap was used for design purposes.

### Typography
The font I have used for the majority of my site is Patrick Hand SC from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Patrick+Hand+SC). I choose this font because it has an informal, handwritten style whilst still being easy to read.
### Colour Scheme
I have stuck to a very simplistic black and white colour scheme. The pops of colour come from the products and the hero images on the Home, About Us and FAQs pages. The site could easily be adapted in the future to reflect a specific branding but I like the elegant, uncluttered feel it has currently.
### DataBase Diagram    
![Database Schema](media/screengrabs/database_schema.jpg)

## Features:
- ### Top Header
  The top of my site has the Longdog brand name top left. The search bar is situated in the middle of the screen in a prominent position. The 'My Account' and 'Shopping bag' icons are in the top right corner. This layout will be familiar to most users of e-commerce sites and will allow them to navigate the site intuitively.

  ![Nav bar mobile](media/screengrabs/top_header.jpg)
- ### Navigation Bar    
  I used Bootstrap to build my navigation bar, it collapses down on mobile screens and becomes a burger menu. The options available are HOME/ABOUT US/CLOTHING/HOMEWARE/FAQS. The navbar is fixed so it can be accessed easily from wherever the user is in the site.

  ![Nav bar mobile](media/screengrabs/navbar_mobile.jpg)    
  On desktop the user has the same options apart from Home as the Longdog logo at top left will return users to the home page

  ![Nav bar desktop](media/screengrabs/navbar_desktop.jpg)    

  I chose to keep the search option available to non-registered users as I wanted first-time visitors to be able to explore the site and its products before committing to registering.
  Underneath the navbar is a banner advertising the free delivery threshold of Â£50. This banner could be easily changed by the site administrator to display special offers or any other information they wanted to convey.    

- ### Home Page    
  ![Home page](media/screengrabs/home.jpg)    
  The home page is simple with just the hero image, a short introductory text panel and a call to action button. The home page is really just a taster and a means to direct the user to the areas of the site they are interested in. The hero image by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@sapegin?utm_content=creditCopyText&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=unsplash">Artem Sapegin</a> on <a href="https://unsplash.com/photos/short-coated-brown-dog-Ugg-EIfzy0c?utm_content=creditCopyText&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=unsplash">Unsplash</a> really grabs the users attention but also conveys the type of products that the site will be selling - elegant and stylish.
  The short text panel welcomes the user to Longdog but it is expected that as it is a sighthound specific site that the user will probably have been directed there by user recommendation or a site engine search so does not go into detail about the site.
  The prominent 'Shop Now' button is a call to action directing users to the Products page.


- ### About Us Page    
  ![About Us page](media/screengrabs/about_us.jpg)  
  The About Us page is probably the first place that new visitors will navigate to. The page is split into two sections, on desktop the first section 'About Us' has an image and text box displayed side-by-side whereas on mobile these are stacked.

  ![Contact Us page](media/screengrabs/contact_us.jpg)      
  The second section 'Contact Us' contains a message form. There are input fields for Subject, message and email address which are all required fields. A non-registered user can send a message which I saw as a way to encourage new visitors to engage with the site owners and obtain information without commitment.
  The Contact Us form is also linked to from the FAQs page under the 'Contact Us' subject header.
  Once the user has submitted their message they will receive a confirmation pop-up message in the top right of the screen, this message can be dismissed by clicking the close icon. 

- ### Products Page  
  ![Products Page](media/screengrabs/products.jpg)    
  The user navigates to the products pages by selecting one of two categories CLOTHING or HOMEWARE. I chose these two as they encompass the range of products that I wanted to sell. Clothing is further broken down into Pyjamas & Housecoats, Outdoor Coats and Accessories. Homeware is further broken down into Beds, Feeding and Toys. It would be very easy to expand these categories in the future as the website grows.
  Once on the Products page you are presented with a 'sort box' dropdown which allows you to sort by Price or Name (ascending & descending). There is a counter that informs the user how many products are in the category selected.
  Each product has an image, name and price. I could have added more information but in order to keep the view manageable on mobiles I chose these three features. There is a 'back to top' arrow in the bottom right corner to enable the user to return quickly to the top without having to scroll.
  Once the user finds a product they are interested in they can click on the image and this will take them to the Product Detail page.

- ### Product Detail Page  
  ![Product Detail](media/screengrabs/product_detail.jpg)      
  The product detail page provides more detail about the selected product. At present there is only one image per product but I would like to develop this in the future to display a carousel of images and the ability to zoom in on an image as I think this is expected from most users.
  Under the image there is the Product Name, Price and a Description. This description provides more information and in the case of products with sizes it directs users towards the measuring guide within the FAQs section. It would have been nice to make the measuring chart a modal that pops up when clicked but unfortunately I ran out of time.
  Next there is a Size dropdown box with the options S, M or L, again this could obviously be developed further to include a wider range if required.
  There is also a Quantity dropdown box for the user to select how many they would like to purchase. The range has been set from 1-99 as default.
  Underneath there are two button options 'Keep Shopping' which returns the user to the Products page so they can continue browsing or 'Add to Bag' which will display a pop-up success message confirming that the product has been added to the bag with a summary of the contents.
  Finally at the bottom of the page there is a Reviews section. This section allows all users to read posted reviews but also gives registered users the option to write a review.    
  ![Add review](media/screengrabs/add_review.jpg)     
  The form has input fields for User, Title and Review. There is also a dropdown from which the user can select the product they are reviewing. In the future I would like to pre-populate this with the product details as a dropdown would become very unwieldly. At the bottom of the form the user has the option to 'Cancel' or 'Submit' their review. The user can only edit/delete their own reviews not other users. At the moment the reviews are posted without being checked by the admin but this would obviously be a useful feature to implement. 

- ### Shopping Bag Page    
  ![Shopping Bag page](media/screengrabs/bag.jpg)  
  The Shopping Bag view details the contents of your bag before checking out. It displays the product image, name, size (if applicable) and price. Beneath each item there is the option to increase or decrease the quantities or remove the item completely. If any of these options are taken the bags grand total adjusts accordingly. There is also a really handy message displaying how much more you need to spend to obtain Free Delivery. This will obviously be an incentive to make an extra purchase to save on the delivery costs.
  Once the user is happy they can either 'Keep Shopping' or proceed to the 'Secure Checkout' via the buttons on screen.

- ### Checkout Page    
  ![Checkout page](media/screengrabs/checkout.jpg)  
  The Checkout page is split into four sections. The first details the order listing the individual items and giving a grand total. The next section is 'Details' containing a form field asking for Full Name and Email Address (both required fields). Following that there is a 'Delivery' section requiring the user to input Phone No., Address, Poscode and Country. There is then a prompt to encourage non-registered users to create an account or for registered users to login. The advantage of registering being you can keep track of past orders in the 'My Profile' section and also the delivery details will be saved for future purchases. Finally there is the 'Payment' section which asks for a 'Card number' and 'Expiry Date'. Once happy the user can 'Complete Order' or return and 'Adjust Bag'.
  On completion of checkout a confirmation pop-up will appear in the top right-hand corner to provide reassurance that the purchase was successful. The user will also receive an email confirmation of their order.    
  ![Checkout page](media/screengrabs/order_success.jpg)    
  Stripe has been used to facilitate payments. On checkout the following test card details can be entered to simulate the payment process, no actual payment will be taken.    
  Card No: 4242 4242 4242 4242 Exp Date: 12/27 CVS: 111 Zip: 12345

- ### Profile Page    
  ![Profile page](media/screengrabs/profile.jpg)  
  The registered user has the advantage of the Profile page where their past orders can be viewed. The Default Delivery Information is also stored here making subsequent checkouts quicker. The registered user has the option of updating their information here as well.
  There is a really nice amount of detail given on past orders with the order no., date, items and order total. You can also click on the order no. to access more detail such as delivery address and contact details. From the Profile page the user can access the dropdown menu under 'My Account' to Logout. the site admin will also see the added option of 'Site Management' from where products can be added or edited. 

- ### FAQs Page    
  ![FAQs Page](media/screengrabs/faqs.jpg)    
  The FAQs page is where the user can visit to find out the most commonly asked questions. Currently I have questions on measuring your dog, delivery, returns and contact info. I would anticipate this page to be added to as the business develops.
  The top of the page contains a lovely image of two sighthounds by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@pupscruffs?utm_content=creditCopyText&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=unsplash">Katie Bernotsky</a> on <a href="https://unsplash.com/photos/white-and-black-short-coated-dog-YA2jb4V0JAU?utm_content=creditCopyText&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=unsplash">Unsplash</a>.
  I have used a Bootstrap component called Accordion to create the FAQs. This is a really nice feature that displays the header (the question) and once clicked drops down to reveal the content (the answer). This works particularly well on mobiles and fits with my mobile first design.

- ### Sign Up Page    
  ![Sign Up Page](media/screengrabs/signup.jpg)    
  The sign up page is presented to users if they choose to register either by selecting 'Register' from the My Account dropdown or as part of the checkout process. They are reminded that if they already have an account they can simply 'Sign In' instead. The required fields are email, username and password. Notifications are set up to alert users they are already registered or the password they have selected is too short, too easy etc..
  I feel I have the right balance between features non-registered and registered users have access to. Guests can still make purchases which is the purpose of the site and message the site owner but registered users have the added features of being able to leave reviews and checkout quicker. This could be changed in the future if the site owner wanted new features to be restricted to registered users only.

- ### CRUD    
  Within my site users have the ability to:
  * CREATE by adding reviews and sending messages 
  * READ by searching for products within the database
  * UPDATE by editing their orders and reviews
  * DELETE their orders and reviews

The Home Page (Mobile)      
![Lighthouse](media/screengrabs/lighthouse_home_mobile.jpg)    
The Products Page (Mobile)  
![Lighthouse](media/screengrabs/lighthouse_products_mobile.jpg)

### Browser Compatibility
I have tested compatibility on the following browsers. Safari, Chrome, Edge and Firefox.    

### Responsiveness
Responsive on all device sizes - This was checked using [Am I Responsive](https://ui.dev/amiresponsive) and by asking friends and family to test it on their devices. The devices checked included Samsung Galaxy, iPhone 8 and 10, iPad Air, Chromebook, Laptop and PC.

### Manual Testing user stories
I asked family, friends and work colleagues to test my site on their devices and report back any issues. This group encompassed a wide range of ages and abilities. I felt this gave me a fair representation of how my app would be used in a real world situation and the feedback was very useful.

## Deployment
This website is deployed to Heroku from a GitHub repository, the following steps were taken:

#### Creating Repository on GitHub
- First make sure you are signed into [Github](https://github.com/) and go to the code institutes template, which can be found [here](https://github.com/Code-Institute-Org/gitpod-full-template).
- Then click on **use this template** and select **Create a new repository** from the drop-down. Enter the name for the repository and click **Create repository from template**.
- Once the repository was created, I clicked the green **gitpod** button to create a workspace in gitpod so that I could write the code for the site.
  
#### Making a Local Clone
1. Log in to GitHub and locate the [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/LHarveyDev/longdog)
2. Under the repository name, click "Clone or download".
3. To clone the repository using HTTPS, under "Clone with HTTPS", copy the link.
4. Open Git Bash
5. Change the current working directory to the location where you want the cloned directory to be made.
6. Type `git clone`, and then paste the URL you copied in Step 3.

```
$ git clone https://github.com/LHarveyDev/longdog
```

7. Press Enter. Your local clone will be created.

```
$ git clone https://github.com/LHarveyDev/longdog
> Cloning into `CI-Clone`...

> Unpacking objects: 100% (10/10), done.
```

Click [Here](https://help.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/cloning-a-repository#cloning-a-repository-to-github-desktop) to retrieve pictures for some of the buttons and more detailed explanations of the above process.

#### Forking the Github Repository 
By forking the GitHub Repository we make a copy of the original repository on our GitHub account to view and/or make changes without affecting the original repository by using the following steps...

1. Log in to GitHub and locate the [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/LHarveyDev/longdog.git)
2. At the top of the Repository (not top of page) just above the "Settings" Button on the menu, locate the "Fork" Button.
3. You should now have a copy of the original repository in your GitHub account.

#### Creating an app on Heroku
- After creating the repository on GitHub, head over to [heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) and sign in.
- On the home page, click **New** and **Create new app** from the drop down.
- Give the app a name(this must be unique) and select a **region** I chose **Europe** as I am in Europe, Then click **Create app**.

#### Deploying to Heroku.
- In GitPod CLI, the root directory of the project, run: pip3 freeze --local > requirements.txt to create a requirements.txt file containing project dependencies.
- In the Gitpod project workspace root directory, create a new file called Procfile, with capital 'P'. Open the Procfile. - Inside the file, check that web: gunicorn freedog.wsgi:application has been added when creating the file Save the file.
- Push the 2 new files to the GitHub repository
- Login to Heroku, select Create new app, add the name for your app and choose your closest region.
- Navigate to the Deploy tab on Heroku dashboard and select Github, search for your repository and click 'connect'.
- Navigate to the settings tab, click reveal config vars and input the following:

#### Amazon Web Services - AWS & Cloning Instructions

In this project for the storing of static files and images i used Amazon Web Services. The steps I took to achieve this are listed below. 

1. Open up [Amazon Web Services](https://aws.amazon.com/) in your browser
2. Click on Create AWS Account 
3. You will need to complete all of the required questions asked by Amazon during the sign in process relative to you.
4. Once registration is complete you can navigate to your AWS dashboard
5. I used Amazon S3 services, if its your first time on the dashboard the quickest way to find it is to type S3 into the search bar. 
6. When you select S3 you will see a button that says "Create Bucket", click this and give your bucket a name. Tip: Name your bucket something relevant to the project its associated with. You will also need to select the region closest to you in the drop down menu also on this page. 
7. Un-tick the box that says "Block all public access". AWS may give you a warning but you can ignore this as the static files need to be public. Now click the "Create bucket" button

> Go to bucket properties<br>
> Turn on static web hosting<br>
> in the index and error text inputs, add index.html and error.html and then save<br>

8. On the permissions tab in the CORS configuration section i used the code below.

![CORS Configuration](media/screengrabs/cors_config.jpg)


9. Now go to the bucket policy tab and select policy generator. I selected the following:<br>
> Type Of Policy: S3 bucket policy<br>
> From action drop down select: "get object"<br>
> You will be asked for your ARN, copy and paste it from the bucket policy page.<br>
> Click add statement<br>
> Then click on the generate policy button<br>
> Then copy and paste the new policy thats generated into your bucket policy<br>
> Be sure to add /* onto the end of the resources key<br>
> Click save.<br>

10. Now go to Access Control List, set list objects permission to everyone (Public)

11. We now ned to create a new group and user to access the bucket. Navigate back to the search page and type in the search box IAM (Identity Access Management) 
> Click create a new group and name it, a good one is manage-`insert project name here`<br>
> Click through the pages and click on the create group button<br>

12. Now we need ot create a group policy. Click on policies option in the menu and click on create policy
> Select the JSON tab and then import managed policies.
> search s3 and select on Amazons3fullaccess and import.
> In the resources section, paste in the ARN that we used previously. You will want to enter the ARN twice and at the end of the second one add a *

> Click through to review policy, give it a name and description and click generate policy

13. Now click on groups again from the side menu, select the group you had previously created, click attach policy, search for the policy we created using the search bar, and then click attach policy. 

14. Finally we need to create a user. Click users from the menu, click add user, create a user name, select programmatic access and click next. 

15. Select the group to add your user too, click through to the end and then click create user. Download the CSV file containing the user keys needed to access the app<br>
<strong>Warning: Do not share the keys from this CSV file with anyone or make them public by pushing them to your Github</strong><br><br>

#### Connect bucket to Django & Cloning Instructions

To connect Django to the bucket I followed the following steps. 

1. Install 2 new packages
`pip3 install boto3`
`pip3 install django-storages`

2. Again we need to freeze these so they are added to the requirements.txt file and deployed ot Heroku when we deploy
`pip3 freeze > requirements.txt`

3. In settings.py we will then need to add `storages` to the installed apps section.

4. An environment variable called USE_AWS needs to be set up to run the code on Heroku.

5. Now back in Heroku click on settings tab and then click reveal config vars, set up the environmental variables as required. USE_AWS should have a value of True.

6. At this point i also deleted the `DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC` variable. 

7. Now back in Gitpod we need to create a custom_storages.py file to tell django that in production we want to use Amazon S3 to store our static and media files. The 2 custom classes we need ot use to action this is:

`class StaticStorage(S3Boto3Storage):`
&nbsp;&nbsp;`location = settings.STATICFILES_LOCATION`

`class MediaStorage(S3Boto3Storage):`
&nbsp;&nbsp;`location = settings.MEDIAFILES_LOCATION`

8. Now save, add, commit and push to Github for the above changes to take place.

#### Add Media files to AWS & Cloning Instructions

Finally we need to upload all the images to S3. To do this I followed the following steps:

1. Back on AWS in your AWS bucket, create a new folder called media
2. Select upload and then upload all your image folders and files. When uploading the files be sure to set the permissions to Everyone (Public access) 

#### Stripe & Cloning Instructions

The final step now is to add the stripe keys to the config variables. These values you can get from your stripe dashboard,. 
Remember all of your config vars need to match what you have in your settings.py file.
