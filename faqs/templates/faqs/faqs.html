                            <p>All our dog clothing is available in sizes Small, Medium or Large. The measurement you will need is the length of back. Please measure from the base of the neck to the top of the tail. We recommend taking the measurement at least twice and you may find it easier to use a piece of string and then measure that. Please don't allow any extra when measuring as this has already been accounted for.
